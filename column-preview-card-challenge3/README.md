## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on these challenge i have learned flexbox, positions, HTML Semantic element and Media queries.

```html
<main class="card"> </main>
```
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    width: 55rem;
    margin:25vh auto 0 auto;
  }
  div {
    height: 30rem;
  }
  p {
    width:72%;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
  }
  .btn {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

The area i need to more focus and learn in CSS and HTML are:

  1)transform
  2)translate
  3)pseudo-elements
  4)HTML Semantic where i need to use it
  5)float
  6)grid
